			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a creative and reliable person and I love doing things that are digital and I love video games like Genshin impact, Arknights and various other games except horror.</p>I like traveling to other places like France, Australia and Singapore. When I'm around those places I do like taking photos and use social medias like Whatsapp and Discord to show my social media friends on my travels.</p>I also like volenteering to adventure activities like Hiking, Swimming and riding ATVs with the group. I'm currently unemployed and I hope to get a job that is part of being in a game design.</p>
