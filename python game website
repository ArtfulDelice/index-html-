                <ul>
                    <li>We used the "Live Share" extension on VSC so everybody could code and see what changes others were
                        doing.
                        We were able to collaborate smoothly, which was very useful.</li>
                    <li>One of the team members had a good knowledge of coding and this allowed the team to be more
                        efficient.</li>
                    <li>Interaction between team members went really well and everyone actively contributed when
                        required.</li>

                    <li>We would split the work load better and delegate more or less functions to each member of the team.</li>
                    <li>Involve every members of the team in writing of the code, which would allow us to understand it
                        better.</li>
